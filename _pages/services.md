## Weddings, Parties and Events

- Meeting your music requirements is easily achieved by a free **face-to-face, video or phone consultation** to outline the finer details of your event in person

- **Song selection** is made as easy as possible! We're flexible, so it's as simple as sending us an email outlining your favourite songs, or linking us to your playlist on your preferred music streaming service (Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play or other)

- Our **music library** is comprised of over _15, 000 songs_, and we take special care to make sure they are edited free of explicit content to keep things family friendly if need be

- **Song requests** are up to your discretion, that gives _you_ the power to decide what wants to be heard at your event. We expect that your guests will appreciate a personalised touch to the music, but we also respect that the music be tailored to _your taste_

- With setup and testing of equipment being completed prior to your guests arrival, you can rest assured knowing there will be **no nasty surprises** on your special night
